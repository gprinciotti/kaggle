# Kaggle Playground Series

This repository contains experiments and analyses for Kaggle's Playground Series competitions. The goal is to explore machine learning techniques and compare them with simpler models, like the ones I learned in my econometrics classes :p

## Project structure

- **data**: Datasets used for the competitions. (Note: datasets are not included in the repo; download them directly from Kaggle.)
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with EDA, feature engineering, and model training. The filenames are intuitive.
- **outputs**: Predictions saved as submission.csv, just as Kaggle requires.
- **src**: A few utility scripts (utils.py)
